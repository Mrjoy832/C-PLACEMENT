# Intro
## Header:
```c
#include<stdio.h>//standard input-output 
```


### C is a middle level language.
```txt
1. c is used for both hardware and enterprise level of coding.

Example: Microsoft uses C to make Windows(hardware -OS) also used to make Software like Excel Spreedsheet.
2. C is reusable

3. It supports garbage collection
4. it used to virtual machine and user friendly.

```

### widely used in OS and embeded system.
### variables are case-sensitive


## Limitations:
- It's a procedural lang.
- code reuse is not that good(As no OOPS concept)\

## Low Level Languages- Assembly & Machine :
- Low levels are those which are close to hardware
- 8 bits =1 byte
- High levels are which are more closely to humans i.e. more readble

## Assembler, Compiler Interpreter, Linker ,Loader

- **Assembler** -> compiler focues on Assembly Language(Low level) or Machine/Binary Code
- **Compiler**-> platform dependent(Winows/Linux) converts high level language to binary code
- **Interpreter**->almost same as Compiler but not as smart as Compiler. it needs lesser memory

- **Linker**-> to run any code we need header file . So **Linker** links all the neccessary parts except the main code with the code 

- **Loader**-> its the program that loads machine code or instruction to the RAM.

- **Source Code** -> whatever we write 
- **Executable Code**-> converted code with Added Linker
